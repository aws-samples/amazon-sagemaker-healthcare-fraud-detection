    "Medicare is a federal healthcare program created in 1965 with the passage of the Social Security Amendments to ensure that citizens 65 and older as well as younger persons with certain disabilities have access to quality healthcare. Medicare is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS manages Medicare programs by selecting official Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) to process the Medicare claims associated with various parts of Medicare. We propose a solution to apply unsupervised outlier techniques at post-payment stage to detect fraudulent patterns of received insurance claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "Health care insurance fraud is a pressing problem, causing substantial and increasing costs in medical insurance programs. Due to large amounts of claims submitted, review of individual claims becomes a difficult task and encourages the employment of automated pre-payment controls and better post-payment decision support tools to enable subject matter expert analysis. We will demonstrate the unsupervised anomalous outlier techniques on a minimal set of metrics made available in the CMS Medicare inpatient claims from 2008. Once more data is available as extracts from different systems  -Medicaid Information Management systems(MMIS), Medicaid Statistical Information Systems(MSIS), Medicaid Reference data such as Provider Files, Death Master Files, etc. - there is an opportunity to build a database of metrics to make the fraud detection technique more robust. The method can be used to flag claims as a targeting method for further investigation. "

If your neighbor’s position is greater than the maximum window width to the left or the right, then some neighbors are not considered as being related to the target word. In theory, a smaller window should give you terms that are more related. If you have lots of data, then the window size should not matter too much, as long as its not overly narrow or overly broad. If you are not too sure about this, just use the default value.\n",
